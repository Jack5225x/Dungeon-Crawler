# Dungeon-Crawler
A WIP game that may or may not end up being finished (or started). It may end up being a dungeon crawler but who really knows.
I'm mainly doing this to learn more Java and get better at it so we'll see. 

All of the sprites in the game including the title screen, text, etc. were made by me in Piskler.

At this point there is a title screen that sorta works and a basic inventory system with equipment slots and character stats.

Here's the title screen so far. I'm not super happy with it, but what's new. ![title](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jack5225x/Dungeon-Crawler/master/Sprites/TitleScreen/NewTitleScreenBackground.gif)
